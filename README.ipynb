    "1. **Setup**: There are three doors. Behind one door is a car, and behind the other two doors are goats.\n",
    "2. **Initial Choice**: You pick one of the doors.\n",
    "3. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat.\n",
    "4. **Decision**: You are then given the option to stick with your original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Twist\n",
    "- **Switching**: Surprisingly, you should always switch doors! When you switch, your chances of winning the car increase to **2/3**, while sticking with your original choice gives you only a **1/3** chance.\n",
