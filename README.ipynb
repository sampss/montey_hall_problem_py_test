    "1. **Setup**: There are three doors. Behind one door is a car, and behind the other two doors are goats.\n",
    "2. **Initial Choice**: You pick one of the doors.\n",
    "3. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat.\n",
    "4. **Decision**: You are then given the option to stick with your original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door.\n",

    "### The Twist\n",
    "- **Switching**: Surprisingly, you should always switch doors! When you switch, your chances of winning the car increase to **2/3**, while sticking with your original choice gives you only a **1/3** chance.\n",

    "### The Intuitive Reasoning Behind the Monty Hall Problem\n",
    "When you first pick a door, there's a 1/3 chance that you picked the car and a 2/3 chance that you picked a goat. Here's where it gets interesting:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Breakdown\n",
    "**Initial Choice**:\n",
    "- You have a 1/3 chance of picking the car.\n",
    "- You have a 2/3 chance of picking a goat.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Host's Action**:\n",
    "- Regardless of your initial pick, the host will always open a door to reveal a goat.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Switching Strategy**:\n",
    "- **If you initially picked the car** (1/3 chance), switching means you will pick a goat.\n",
    "- **If you initially picked a goat** (2/3 chance), switching means you will pick the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Switching is Better:\n",
    "- **Initial Probability**: Your initial chance of picking the car is 1/3. This does not change.\n",
    "- **Complementary Probability**: The remaining 2/3 probability is shifted to the unopened door after the host opens a door to reveal a goat.\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: Switching doors doubles your chances of winning from 1/3 to 2/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualization\n",
    "Consider the scenarios:\n",
    "- **Scenario 1**: Pick the car first (1/3 chance). Switching results in a loss.\n",
    "- **Scenario 2**: Pick a goat first (2/3 chance). Switching results in a win.\n",
    "\n",
    "By switching, you benefit from the higher probability (2/3) that you initially picked a goat, turning the odds in your favor.\n"
