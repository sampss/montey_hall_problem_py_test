### Monty Hall Problem
1. **Setup**: There are three doors. Behind one door is a car, and behind the other two doors are goats.
2. **Initial Choice**: You pick one of the doors.
3. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat.
4. **Decision**: You are then given the option to stick with your original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door.

### The Twist
- **Switching**: Surprisingly, you should always switch doors! When you switch, your chances of winning the car increase to **2/3**, while sticking with your original choice gives you only a **1/3** chance.
